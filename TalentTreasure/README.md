I have used file based routing for Get started, Read more, Login and dashboard pages. Login button allows users to login via various platforms. I have used Github provider of next-auth.js for login and authentication. Various functionalities of an active session are created using next-auth.

After signing in with github, it loads a dashboard to enter the required details which are stored in the database.

The dropdown after login allows users to navigate to different pages and allows sign out using sign out dropdown or a separate logout button. It also allows the user to navigate to their respective pages.

I am currently working on the payment page and integrating a payment gateway. Followers can enter their name, amount and a message which will be displayed on the Supporters list if the payment is successfull.

I have created User and Payment models which have details about User and Payment. I have used Mongoose to interact with the MongoDb database.
```

```
I will complete this project within a few days by incorporating the paymnet gateway of Cashfree paymnets using Test mode API keys for payment functionality, working on the remaining pages and then make some UI changes. I then plan to host it.
